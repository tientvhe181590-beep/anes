# Pencil Designs for ANES

All designs are created using Pencil, based on previous mockups in documentations, enhanced visuals, and new ideas.

# What is Pencil?

Pencil is a powerful vector design tool that integrates directly into your development environment. Unlike traditional design tools that run in separate applications or browser tabs, Pencil lives right inside your IDE alongside your code.

# Why Pencil?

Pencil bridges the gap between design and development by putting both in the same environment. Design components, sync them with your code, and let AI assistants help you maintain consistency between design and implementation.
